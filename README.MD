Inheritance:
The Inheritance.js file creates a Parent and Child class. Using the super method, 
the child class can grab values from its parent class.

Polymorphism:
Using the same Inheritance file, an example of Polymorphism could be where the child class
grabs and uses the same method from its Parent class. 

Encapsulation:
In the Encapsulation.js file, the method "Hallway" cannot use the variable "desks" that has
been specified and instantiated in the "RoomOne" method, as the variable has been
encapsulated in the "RoomOne" method. 

Abstraction:
The Abstraction.js file creates a class in which its methods are simple to read/understand and can be used
with relatively wide flexibility.
